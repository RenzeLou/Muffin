    "input": "Article: We all use money every day. It is essential because we can pay money for whatever we want.Money is recognized as banknotes and coins. However,many years ago people couldn' t go to the shop and buy what they wanted.They had to get what they wanted through the barter trade .It was really difficult,for the barter often depended on coincidence of wants.For example,the seller of grain has to find a buyer who wants to buy grain and who also could offer something the seller wants to buy.And one more example,if a wheat farmer needs what a fruit farmer produces,a direct exchange is impossible because seasonal fruit would spoil before the grain harvest.The solution is to trade fruit for wheat indirectly through a third intermediate commodity ,such as cattle,salt,shells,wine.However,commodity money had their disadvantages.For example,cattle,fur,precious stones couldn' t be cut into smaller pieces and it was inconvenient to keep and transport them.Thus coins were invented. The earliest known coins in the western world came from Lydia in about 650 B.C.Greek cities,the Great Persian Empire and Roman Empire quickly adopted the new useful technique of metal currency.And by the end of the 6th century,coinages were common throughout the region.However,coins as well as commodity money had many disadvantages.For instance,coins quickly show wear  and they usually have small value,so it' s difficult to count large sums of coins. At first,paper money was used in China in about 650 A.D.After then,it was used in Persia and Japan.In Europe,paper money was firstly produced in the Netherlands in the 16th century and in the USA in the 17th century.Paper money is worthless but symbolic.In other words,paper money is just a note.It has a purchasing power because the government announces it as money and citizens accept it universally. \n Question: The writer explains the difficulty of barter trade by  _  . \n Options: (A) telling stories (B) using examples (C) presenting a theory (D) making a comparison \n Asnwer: B",

Passersby were taken aback by the unusual sight and immediately alerted the authorities.\n\nLocal law enforcement arrived at the scene promptly and attempted to communicate with the man, but he remained unresponsive. Paramedics were called in to assess his condition, but they could not find any physical injuries or signs of trauma. The man's numb expression persisted, adding to the mystery surrounding the incident.\n\nAuthorities have launched an investigation into the incident, hoping to shed light on what caused the man's unusual state.

At this point, we cannot rule out any possibilities, including medical conditions or psychological factors.\"\n\nWitnesses have been interviewed by the police, and their accounts are being carefully analyzed.

They are also appealing to the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behavior they may observe.\n\nThe man with the numb expression has been taken to a local hospital for further evaluation. Medical professionals are working to determine the cause of his condition and provide appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, the community remains on edge, with many speculating about the possible explanations for the man's numb expression.

This eliminates the need for workers to spend time and resources on multiple trips, allowing them to focus on the construction project itself. Renting a dumpster also eliminates the need to purchase expensive equipment for waste disposal, saving money in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, renting dumpsters ensures compliance with environmental regulations. Construction projects are subject to various environmental regulations, including proper waste disposal and recycling. Casella, as a responsible provider of dumpster rentals in Unity, NH, takes pride in protecting environmental resources.

Cooperative game theory provides a framework for formulating such strategies.

We are writing on behalf of the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO) and the Local Government Unit (LGU) of La Trinidad, Benguet, regarding an issue that has been brought to our attention.\n\nIt has come to our knowledge that some business establishments in our municipality have denied or not honored the Discount I.D. Cards issued to Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). We understand that this has caused inconvenience and frustration for the PWD community, as they are unable to fully enjoy the privileges afforded by these cards.\n\nWe would like to request an explanation for this behavior from your establishment. We believe that it is important to understand the reasons behind the denial or non-honoring of the Discount I.D. Cards, as this will help us address the issue effectively. We kindly ask you to provide us with the specific reasons or concerns that have led to this decision.\n\nFurthermore, we would like to propose solutions to ensure that PWDs are able to fully enjoy the privileges of the Discount I.D. Cards. We understand that there may have been a lack of communication or awareness regarding the issuance of these cards. To address this, we suggest the following measures:\n\n1. Awareness Campaign: We propose conducting an awareness campaign to inform business establishments about the Discount I.D. Cards and the privileges they afford to PWDs. This can be done through the distribution of informational materials, workshops, or seminars.\n\n2. Memo from the Municipal Mayor: We will coordinate with the municipal mayor to issue a memo or notice to all business establishments, emphasizing the importance of honoring the Discount I.D. Cards and the consequences of non-compliance.\n\n3. Collaboration with Business Associations: We will engage with local business associations to promote inclusivity and encourage their members to honor the Discount I.D. Cards. This can be done through meetings, dialogues, or joint initiatives.\n\nWe believe that by implementing these proposed solutions, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for PWDs in our municipality. We value your cooperation and partnership in this endeavor.\n\nWe kindly request your prompt response to this letter, as we aim to address this issue as soon as possible. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us at [MSWDO/LGU Contact Information].\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[MSWDO/LGU Representative Name]\n[Position]\n[Contact Information]",

However, we have noticed a disturbing trend of unfair reimbursement practices that are negatively impacting our members' ability to provide the level of care that our patients deserve.\n\nPhysicians are facing increasing challenges in maintaining their practices due to restrictions on physician autonomy and the erosion of valuable legislation that protects physicians' practices. These unfair practices not only hinder the delivery of quality healthcare but also have a detrimental effect on the financial stability of our members' practices.\n\nWe strongly believe that fair compensation is essential to ensure the sustainability of our healthcare system. Physicians invest years of education, training, and experience to provide the best possible care to their patients. It is only fair that they are adequately compensated for their expertise and dedication.\n\nWe urge you to reconsider your reimbursement practices and work towards a fair and transparent system that values the contributions of physicians. By doing so, you will not only support the physicians in our network but also contribute to the overall improvement of healthcare in our community.\n\nWe appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a positive response.

In the control group, the routine rehabilitation regimen was adopted. In the experimental group, on the base of the treatment regimen as the control group, the \"Jin's three-needle\" therapy was supplemented. The neurological function deficit score was used to assess the neurological function. The modified Fugel-Meyer assessment for upper extremities (FMA) and motor assessment scale (MAS) were adopted to assess the upper limb motor function in patients. The modified Barthel Index (MBI) was used to evaluate the activity of daily living (ADL) in patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter treatment, the neurological function deficit score, the upper limb motor function (FMA and MAS) and ADL (MBI) were all improved obviously as compared with those before treatment (P<0.05). In the experimental group, the reducing range of neurological function deficit score (difference value) was larger than that in the control group (P<0.05). The increases of FMA score (upper arm function), the total score of MAS, the score for hand movement in MAS and the score for advanced hand activities of MAS, as well as MBI score in the experimental group were significantly larger than those in the control group successively (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\"Jin's three-needle\" therapy combined with exercise relearning regimen effectively reduces the degree of neurological deficit and improve the upper limb motor function and ADL in patients with ischemic stroke.",

They had come to San Francisco to film some scenes for the show, and the long and windy hills provided the perfect backdrop for their on-screen adventures.\n\nAs they walked, they marveled at the stunning views of the city. The Golden Gate Bridge stood majestically in the distance, its red-orange hue contrasting beautifully against the blue sky. The Transamerica Pyramid, with its sleek and modern design, seemed to reach for the heavens.\n\nThe streets of San Francisco were bustling with activity. People from all walks of life went about their day, their footsteps echoing on the pavement. The sound of cable cars filled the air, their bells ringing in harmony with the laughter and chatter of the city.\n\nThe group continued their descent down the hills, their footsteps synchronized as if they were dancing to an invisible rhythm. They couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty that surrounded them.\n\nAs they reached the bottom of the hills, they found themselves in a quaint neighborhood filled with colorful Victorian houses. Each house seemed to have its own unique charm, with vibrant paint colors and intricate architectural details.\n\nThe group paused for a moment to catch their breath and take in the sights. They knew that this experience would be etched in their memories forever. The combination of the physical action of walking down the long and windy hills and the picturesque setting of San Francisco created a magical moment that they would never forget.\n\nAnd so, they continued their journey through the streets of San Francisco, ready to create more memories and bring the world of Monk to life. As they walked, they couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to be a part of something so special.",

She called me into the room, telling me she had to show me something. I was expecting it to be a funny picture of our cat, or a video she found that I would be interested in. Instead, when I walked into the bedroom she handed me a home pregnancy test. She told me she was pregnant, she had just taken the test and wanted to tell me right away. I was so surprised. We were not really trying to get pregnant, but we were so excited right away. I couldn't believe that this was a journey we were going to start taking together. Later that night, we spent a long time sitting and talking about everything. We went over some decisions we are going to have to make for our baby, and how we would make them. She asked me for help finding a doctor and getting an appointment set up. This was all stuff that would have normally been so boring, but it wasn't. It was for our baby, so we were having fun even figuring out insurance things.

They transformed the spare room into a cozy nursery, painting the walls a soft shade of blue and carefully selecting furniture and decorations. They spent hours browsing through baby stores, picking out adorable onesies, tiny socks, and soft blankets. Each purchase filled them with a sense of joy and anticipation.\n\nThe couple also attended parenting classes together, eager to learn everything they could about taking care of their little one. They listened attentively as the instructor explained the importance of a proper diet during pregnancy, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the basics of infant care. They took notes and asked questions, determined to be the best parents they could be.\n\nAs the due date approached, the couple's excitement reached new heights. They packed their hospital bags, making sure to include all the essentials for both mom and baby. They installed the car seat, practicing how to secure it properly and imagining the day they would bring their little bundle of joy home.\n\nFinally, the day arrived. The couple rushed to the hospital, their hearts filled with a mix of nervousness and overwhelming love. Hours later, their baby was born, and their lives were forever changed. They marveled at the tiny fingers and toes, the soft cries, and the overwhelming sense of love that washed over them.\n\nIn the days that followed, the couple navigated the sleepless nights and endless diaper changes with a newfound sense of purpose. They supported each other through the challenges and celebrated every milestone, from the first smile to the first steps.\n\nTheir journey as parents had just begun, and they knew there would be ups and downs along the way. But they were ready to face it all, knowing that the love they had for their child would guide them through any obstacle. And as they looked into their baby's eyes, they knew that this was the start of a beautiful adventure filled with love, laughter, and endless joy.",

The cartridge was intended for police work and personal defense, using a 200 grain bullet at 900 feet per second. While proposed as early as 1955, it remains a niche, custom cartridge.\nHistory.\nIn 1932, Colt researched a proposed \".41 Special\" cartridge, but that shared only a name with the modern wildcat, having different measurements and even different bore diameter (.385). The concept of a .41 Special was later brought up by gunwriter Elmer Keith in his 1955 work \"Sixguns\", where he proposed the .41 as an analog to the .44 Special cartridge, but the idea did not gain ground.\nKeith and Bill Jordan later proposed the .41 Magnum cartridge, which was formally adopted by Remington Arms in 1964. Thus counter to common practice, a \"magnum\" offering was standardized before a weaker \"special\" variant was ever introduced.\nIn the late 1980s pistolsmith Hamilton Bowen revived the idea of a 200gr bullet at 900fps in his custom designs.\nFirearms.\nWhile large-scale production firearms have not been produced for this niche chambering, custom gunsmiths have adapted existing firearms to use it, generally by machining a new cylinder and expanding the bore of existing .357 Magnum revolvers.\nAmmunition is not commercially produced, but boutique runs of brass for handloading, with proper .41 Special headstamps, have been issued.\nAmong the first gunsmiths to make a purpose-built firearm for this chambering was Hamilton Bowen, who modified the .357 caliber Ruger Security-Six and GP100 revolvers to accommodate the .41 Special, as well as a Colt revolver and a S&amp;W 586.",

On the other hand, the variability of practice hypothesis derived from schema theory proposes that experiences with task variations are vital to the development of the memories (schemata) responsible for response production and learning. This paper contrasts these two positions in two experiments aimed at determining the influence of providing variable and/or specific acquisition experiences on the retention of a force production task. The results clearly indicated that acquisition practice with variations of the criterion task leads to better retention than practice on the criterion task alone. This finding is contrary to a strict interpretation of the specificity of learning principle and suggests that paradigms investigating schema notions should be expanded to include potential impacts of variability of practice on tasks experienced during acquisition.",

In the other eight states, the insurance companies that CNN queried claimed they do not do this.\nIf there are going to be private health-insurance companies (and I don't think there should be), I propose we simply ban Pre-Existing Conditions .

The problem is when I run more then 1 hour because I don't see the seconds as it has only 4 digits on the display., Review_3: Extremely easy to use, only one button. Seems to be fairly accurate. Has a backlight and can beep to warn you if you fall out of a target heart range that is completely programmable. However, the battery is not replaceable and the screen scratches easily., Review_4: I was disapointed to find the booklet with it didn't help with any instructions on use. But after checking the manual on the internet I was able to set it up and use it. It is much easier than others I have purchased. This is what I was looking for. Ease of use., Review_5: This is a good monitor if you have no need for the fancy training models. Beginner or non-competitive runners should stick to basic types like this. The Polar monitors I have had like this are well-made and easy to use and this is no exception. I am coming off a long layoff and plan to use this to work back into shape without risking overtraining., Review_6: If you're looking for just a heart rate monitor (it is waterproof and good for swimming) then this is for you. There aren't any bells and whistles at all. Straight forward, heart rate, time of exercise and that's it. The log only stores your last workouts data, you need to record it before you start another session., Review_7: This was very well-rated on consumer reports. I really like that you can plug in your target heart rate, and it has an audible alert to let you know when you're there. The display is easy to read and it's light-weight., Review_8: I ordered and Polar FT2 and it was confirmed after the order was processed. When I got the email for confirmation, it said FT1.

The spreading centre has high topographic relief and contains an axial rift, which has flanks that are suitable for dredging. The plan was to map the spreading centre using the swath bathymetry system, and then to use this map to locate the best dredging sites. Thirteen dredges were successful in recovering oceanic rocks of mixed sizes, up to and including very large boulders and dredge paths of up to 1 km were followed.\nDescription: This document is the Cruise Report, contianing a description of the field work undertaken in 2004 for this project, submited to the British Oceanographic Data Centre (\"BODC\").\nData Center URL: http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_bas/our_organisation/eid/pdc/ind...\nPearce J.A. 2005.

However, all LEO laboratories are subject to transient accelerations (g\u2010jitter) superimposed on the steady reduced gravity environment of the space platform. In measurements of the diffusion coefficients for dilute binary alloys of Pb\u2010(Ag, Au,Sb), Sb\u2010(Ga,In), Bi\u2010(Ag,Au,Sb), Sn\u2010(Au,Sb), Al\u2010(Fe, Ni,Si), and In\u2010Sb in which g\u2010jitter was suppressed, it was found that D\u221dT (temperature) if g\u2010jitter was suppressed, rather than D\u221d T2 as observed by earlier workers with g\u2010jitter present. Furthermore, when a forced g\u2010jitter was applied to a diffusion couple, the value measured for D increased. The significance of these results is reviewed in the light of recent work in which ab initio molecular dynamics simulations predicted a D\u221dT relationship.",

        "output": "The significance of suppressing g-jitter during measurements of the diffusion coefficients for dilute binary alloys of various metals and metalloids is that it leads to a different relationship between the diffusion coefficient (D) and temperature (T). When g-jitter is suppressed, the diffusion coefficient is found to be proportional to the temperature (D\u221dT), whereas when g-jitter is present, the diffusion coefficient is observed to be proportional to the square of the temperature (D\u221dT^2). This difference in the relationship between D and T suggests that g-jitter has an influence on the diffusion process. Additionally, when a forced g-jitter was applied to a diffusion couple, the measured value for D increased, further supporting the significance of g-jitter in diffusion measurements. These results are important in the context of recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which also predicted a D\u221dT relationship.",

I think I accidentally turned him into a bit of an audiophile lol. As for myself, I love these things.The quality is truly amazing. The bass is VERY clean even at very high levels and not overwhelming by any means. The mids and highs are very very nice as well. You can hear so many things extra going on in your music than before making it a completely new experience even with a mobile device. I even tried these out on my FiiO e10 amp/dac and they are even more amazing!I've listened to other earbuds and found these are the best suited for me at a decent price. I can wear these all day long for days on end and not even notice them being in. By far the most comfortable I have ever had. Another great point is the noise cancelling. There is this fat redneck piece of crap that rides in the back of the bus that never ever shuts up with the most annoying girlish cackle that puts you into an instant rage when wanting to sleep. These buds with a very low volume drowns him out very well surprisingly and I sleep great! Definitely a huge bonus when I am away from home for 17 hours a day.Beats headphones are a bloody joke! It annoys me to no end to see people buying that garbage just because it's signed by an uneducated rapper. :\\ I've had a lot of earbuds to know those things don't even compare to the cheapest plastic ear ripping garbage out there. My coworkers I ride the bus with (very long ride every day ugh) are so brainwashed thinking they can somehow justify that massive price they paid. I showed them mine and I could see them lie when they said the Beaters were better. I'll enjoy my music thank you and they can continue to have an orgy of stray cats fighting over living territory in their ears.In summary, I'm far from being an audiophile. Very far. From my experience, headphones were always just that: headphones. Now I've realized they can be so much more! From my experiences, these babies pretty much alleviate any complaints of other headphones I have had in the past. Of course the quality isn't quite at audiophile levels but for the price, they are beyond exceptional. These have got to be the best value out there tailored for my tastes.\nquestion: How do you get so high?",

Samuel was known for his charming personality and his ability to convince anyone of anything. He was absolutely committed to the deception.\n\nOne day, a stranger arrived in the village. His name was Victor, and he was a master of disguise. Victor had heard of Samuel's reputation and sought him out for a special mission. He needed Samuel's expertise in deception to help him retrieve a valuable artifact that was hidden in a nearby castle.\n\nSamuel was intrigued by the challenge and agreed to help Victor. They spent days planning their strategy, coming up with elaborate disguises and intricate plans to outsmart the guards and retrieve the artifact.\n\nAs they made their way to the castle, Samuel couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. He had always enjoyed the thrill of deception, but this mission was different. It was more dangerous and high-stakes than anything he had ever done before.\n\nInside the castle, they encountered numerous obstacles and challenges. They had to navigate through secret passageways, avoid traps, and outwit the guards. Samuel's skills in deception were put to the test, and he proved himself to be a master of his craft.\n\nFinally, they reached the room where the artifact was kept. It was a small, intricately designed box that held immense power. Samuel and Victor carefully opened the box, revealing the artifact inside. It was a beautiful jewel that shimmered with an otherworldly glow.\n\nBut as Samuel looked at the jewel, he couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt. He had deceived so many people in his life, and now he was stealing something that didn't belong to him. He realized that his commitment to deception had come at a cost.\n\nIn that moment, Samuel made a decision. He turned to Victor and told him that he couldn't go through with the plan. He couldn't be a part of this deception any longer. Victor was disappointed but understood Samuel's change of heart.\n\nTogether, they carefully placed the artifact back in its box and left the castle empty-handed. Samuel had learned a valuable lesson about the consequences of deception and vowed to use his skills for good from that day forward.\n\nAnd so, Samuel returned to his village, a changed man. He used his talents to help others, using deception only when it was necessary and for the greater good. He became known as a trusted advisor and a master of strategy, always using his skills to protect and guide those in need.\n\nIn the end, Samuel's commitment to deception had led him down a path of self-discovery and redemption. He had learned that sometimes, the greatest deception of all is the one we play on ourselves. And by embracing honesty and integrity, he had found true happiness and fulfillment.",

One day Stransom happens to read of the death of Acton Hague, a former friend who had done him a terrible harm.

He begins to light candles at a side altar in a Catholic church, one for each of his Dead, except Hague.\nLater he notices a woman who regularly appears at the church and sits before his altar. He intuitively understands that she too honours her Dead, and they very gradually become friends. However Stransom later discovers that her Dead number only one: Acton Hague.

However, up- or downstaging of nodal status frequently is necessitated by postsurgical findings. This study was conducted to evaluate clinicopathologic features that impact nodal upstaging in patients staged primarily via positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and chest CT prior to surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween years 2011 and 2014, 634 patients underwent surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at our institution. Excluding 37 patients (given induction chemotherapy), 103 patients pathologically staged as N1 or N2 NSCLC. Nodal upstaging patients were classified into group A and non-upstaging patients into group B. We compared clinical characteristics and pathological results of group A with group B.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUltimately, 59 patients (57.3%) were assigned to group A and 44 patients (42.7%) to group B. Patients in group A (vs. group B) were significantly younger (61.6 vs. 68.4 years; P<0.001) and more often were female (47.5% vs. 15.9%; P=0.001), with shorter smoking histories (12.2 vs. 28.8 pack years; P<0.001) and lower maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) (7.3 vs. 10.4; P=0.001). Most upstaged (group A) tumors (50/59, 84.7%) were adenocarcinomas, displaying micropapillary (MPC; n=36) and lepidic (n=35) component positivity with significantly greater frequency (both, P<0.001); and the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (n=36) was significantly greater in this subset (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) indicated a significant correlation between MPC positivity and nodal upstaging (P=0.013).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients upstaged postoperatively to N1 or N2 stage of NSCLC, occult lymph node metastasis and MPC positivity were significantly related.",

    "input": "Why CIA interrogations report matters: Torture doesn't work and Americans need to know. As a former professional interviewer with the FBI, I know what works and doesn't . Torture is not an effective way to get information , and the American people need to know that . That's why the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogation and detention after 9/11 is important . The executive summary of the report, written after reviewing hundreds of thousands of the CIA's internal documents, shows that torture was more brutal and much less fruitful than the CIA claimed . In fact ,  the committee concluded that all the claims about the value of intelligence gained from \"enhanced\" interrogation--including the claim that it helped the U.S  find Usama bin Laden-- are overstated or just plain false . Proponents of torture are contesting these well-documented findings . So let's look at the facts . On 9/11, the CIA had few, if any, experienced counterterrorism interrogators . Their traditional purview had been intelligence collection during the Cold War . Inexperienced in this area and overwhelmed they resorted to techniques that merely sounded good but in fact worked against them . When concocting the legal opinions to authorize torture, the lawyers inside our government didn't consult trained interviewers or interrogation experts--the people who actually knew how to get information . They consulted psychologists who helped train U.S  military pilots to resist torture methods should they be captured (torture methods, it should be noted, designed to elicit false confessions) . If they had consulted trained interviewers , they would have found out what I and my colleagues had known for decades: Torture isn't just unnecessary; it's an unreliable way to get information . Instead , as the Senate report shows, the CIA brought in untrained interrogators and contractors and asked them to get answers out of Al Qaeda detainees using methods designed to inflict pain, both physical and mental, and even simulate death . The CIA also employed horrific methods, like forced rectal feedings, that were never approved . I recall when I learned that cruel techniques were being used . I spoke with several long-term CIA officers and CIA polygraph experts with whom I had worked over many years , and we were all appalled , not just by its immorality , but because we knew it would be counterproductive . Apologists say that these methods were used to put the detainees into a state of \"learned helplessness,\" in which the detainee would depend totally on his captor and give up all information . Those of us who have actually conducted interviews know that this isn't the way things work . To get good, accurate information, you want the subject to be as cognizant as possible . You want him to be able to remember all the details and to be able to tell you them . A person will say anything to try to stop the pain , and torture impairs the suspect's ability to remember the details that may be essential to your investigation . Professionals don't need to use torture and never have . On top of that, torture is illegal, both here in the U.S  and internationally . The United States has even prosecuted people for the methods that the CIA used after 9/11 . We are a nation of laws , and the conduct detailed in the Senate report is against the law . For these reasons, in October, I joined 22 other security, interrogation and interviewing experts to issue a statement of principles in opposition to using torture . Not only is torture less reliable, illegal and immoral, we write , but it also makes our nation less safe . When we are not using effective and legal interviewing tactics, we miss information that may be vital to our nation's safety . In using torture, we also encourage other nations and actors (including terrorist groups) to emulate our illegal actions, effectively lowering the bar for the rest of the world, and allow them to use U.S  torture as a recruiting tool . President Obama, on his second day in office, signed an executive order banning the CIA torture methods the Senate report describes . But this executive order could be overturned by a future president . Now that the Senate report's executive summary has been released and the public knows the just how ineffective and brutal U.S  torture was, we need to make sure that this prohibition is permanent . Working with Congress to pass legislation that makes sure a ban on torture extends to the CIA is one way that President Obama can make sure that the United States never again embraces the misguided, ineffective, and dangerous tactics of torture .",

Recently, a blind channel identification-based adaptive approach called the eigenvalue decomposition (ED) algorithm has been proposed to deal with room reverberation more effectively. The ED algorithm focuses on a system with two channels whose impulse responses can be blindly identified only if they do not share common zeros. The assumption often breaks down for acoustic channels whose impulse responses are long. In this technical memorandum, the blind channel identificationbased time delay estimation approach is generalized to multiple (more than 2) channel systems and a normalized multi-channel frequency-domain LMS algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm is more practical since it is less likely for all channels to share a common zero when more channels are available. It is shown by using the data recorded in the Varechoic chamber at Bell Labs that the proposed method performs better than the ED and GCC algorithms.",

Rules:\n   - Handball is played with two teams, each consisting of seven players (six outfield players and one goalkeeper).\n   - The objective of the game is to score goals by throwing the ball into the opponent's goal.\n   - Players can pass, dribble, or shoot the ball to move it towards the goal.\n   - Players are not allowed to touch the ball with their feet or legs.\n   - Physical contact is allowed, but excessive force or dangerous play is not permitted.\n   - The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins.\n\n2. Equipment needed:\n   - Handball: A handball is a small, round ball made of leather or synthetic material.\n   - Goalposts: Handball is played on a rectangular court with two goalposts at each end.\n   - Court: The court should be 40 meters long and 20 meters wide, with marked lines for boundaries and goal areas.\n   - Team jerseys: Each team should have distinct jerseys or uniforms to differentiate players.\n\n3. Basic techniques:\n   - Passing: Players can pass the ball to their teammates using their hands. The ball can be thrown or rolled on the ground.\n   - Shooting: To score a goal, players need to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal. This can be done by throwing the ball with force and accuracy.\n   - Dribbling: Dribbling is the technique of moving the ball while running or walking. Players can bounce the ball on the ground or hold it in one hand while moving.\n   - Defending: Players can use their bodies to block opponents' shots or passes. The goalkeeper's role is to prevent the ball from entering the goal.\n\nRemember to practice these techniques and familiarize yourself with the rules before playing handball. Enjoy the game!",

Gay communities are responding to a post crisis context. However, is this response constant across different locations? This paper investigates changes in sexual negotiation and behaviour amongst gay men in the relatively small Australian city of Perth between 1998 and 2002 and compares these results to similar studies in Sydney, an Australian HIV epicentre city. A number of important similarities and differences between the Perth and Sydney samples are identified, particularly in casual contexts and disclosure of HIV status, identifying that isolated or smaller cities may experience similar phenomena to larger cities, but these may be due to different reasons. The findings point to the need for complementary qualitative research and cautions health promotion practitioners to test their assumptions when developing responses to prevent HIV transmission.

The `parse()` method returns a `Result` enum, which represents the success or failure of the parsing operation.\n\nLine 14: This line uses a `match` expression to handle the `Result` enum returned by the `parse()` method. If the parsing was successful, the `Ok` variant is matched and the parsed integer is assigned to the `num` variable. If the parsing failed, the `Err` variant is matched and an error message is printed to the console.\n\nLine 16: This line uses a `match` expression to compare the `num` variable with the `secret_number`. The `cmp()` method is used to compare the two values and returns an `Ordering` enum.\n\nLine 17: This line uses a `match` expression to handle the `Ordering` enum returned by the `cmp()` method. If the `Ordering` is `Less`, the string \"Too small!\" is printed to the console. If the `Ordering` is `Greater`, the string \"Too big!\" is printed to the console.

The reaction kinetics have been investigated using UV spectrophotometry and reversed phase HPLC. The determination of 3-isopropyl-5-methylphenol as the main product of promecarb hydrolysis gives evidence for the significant reactivity of this insecticide in alkaline solution. The rate constants were determined following a proposed first-order kinetic model. The positive activation entropy obtained \u0394S\u2260 = +66.82 J mol\u22121 K\u22121 and the absence of general basic catalysis indicates an E1cB mechanism involving unimolecular collapse of the promecarb via a methylisocyanate intermediate.

Context_4 : Ignacio \"Nacho\" Trelles (born 31 July 1916) is a Mexican former football player and coach. He had five tenures as coach of the Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de M\u00e9xico (Mexico national team) in 106 international matches, and was in charge of the Mexico squads at FIFA World Cup tournaments: 1962 and 1966. He guided Mexico to their first win in a FIFA World Cup when they defeated Czechoslovakia 3\u20131 in the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile. At the 1962 FIFA World Cup, Mexico finished eleventh, which was their best ranking in a World Cup outside home soil until 2002 where they also ranked eleventh. Context_5 : The 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th staging of the FIFA World Cup which took place from 31 May to 30 June 2002 in South Korea and Japan. It was the first World Cup to be held in Asia, the first to be held on a continent other than Europe or the Americas, the last World Cup during which the golden goal rule was in force and the only World Cup to be jointly hosted by more than one nation. Brazil won the tournament for a record fifth time, winning the final against Germany 2\u20130. The victory meant Brazil qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup for the fifth time, representing the World. In the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3\u20132 taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup finals. China PR, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia made their first appearances at the finals with Turkey making its first appearance since 1954.

The game is an officially licensed product of the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals held in Germany. \"FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup\" World Cup mode only includes UEFA qualification groups for the 2006 World Cup. Context_7 : The FIFA Fan Fests are public viewing events organized by FIFA and its partners which allow people to watch the FIFA World Cup with thousands of fans from all around the world. The Fan Fest first became part of the official program for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, following the huge success of unofficial public viewing events in South Korea during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It was a great success, leading FIFA to expand it to include several cities worldwide for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The locations are large enough to fit many thousands of people, and feature gigantic LED displays which broadcast the matches live. Context_8 : Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory is a soccer video game based on the FIFA World Cup 1998, despite being released after the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It features 73 teams' countries. Each team enters a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player beats the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of \"Super Sidekicks 3\". However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). Its slogan is \"We got the kick\". Context_9 : Manuel Rosas S\u00e1nchez (April 17, 1912 in Mexico City \u2013 February 20, 1989), nicknamed \"Chaquetas\", was a Mexican footballer who participated in the 1930 FIFA World Cup. He was the first player in the history of FIFA World Cup who scored a goal from the penalty kick spot (against Argentina). With the first goal he scored during the World Cup, he became at the time the youngest player to have scored in the FIFA World Cup, a record later broken by Pel\u00e9, although Rosas remains second youngest. He was also the first Mexican player to score multiple goals in world cup play (the first to score more than two goals was Luis Hernandez, 68 years later) and the first player to score a own goal in the history of FIFA World Cup (against Chile).

    "input": "With almost 300 people still unaccounted for one day after the accident, reports of desperate text messages from some of those trapped on board have surfaced in local media.\n\"This might be the last chance to say I love you,\" one student named as Shin Young-Jin is reported to have texted his mother.\n\"Why's that,\" his mother texted back, clearly unaware of the crisis engulfing the vessel. \"I love you anyway.\"\nAccording to the Korea Herald, he was among the 179 people rescued from the ship so far.\nBut other parents who received such messages have not been reunited with their children.  Another exchange between one student and her father was recounted by the AFP news agency and local media:\nStudent: \"Dad, don't worry. I'm wearing a life vest and am with other girls. We're inside the ship, still in the hallway.\"\nFather: \"I know that the rescue is under way, but shouldn't you be waiting outside the rail? Try to get out if you can.\"\nStudent: \"The ship is too tilted. The hallway is crowded with so many people.\"\nThe student who sent these messages remains unaccounted for.\nIn another text exchange widely published on South Korean media a student texted his older brother as the ship ran into trouble.\nStudent: \"The  ship ran into something and it's not moving. They say the coast guard just arrived.\"\nBrother:  \"Don't panic. Just do what you are told to do and then you will be fine\".\nBut there was no further communication after that.\nSome parents were able to stay in touch with their children on the phone until lines were cut off. Park Yu-Shin, whose daughter is among the missing, told the AFP news agency that she talked to her daughter as she was coping with the emergency.\n\"She was telling me: 'We're putting on our life vests. They're telling us to wait and stay put, so we're waiting...I can see a helicopter\", Ms Park said. Her daughter is still among the missing.\nReports that messages have been received from students still trapped inside the ferry have not been verified.\nIt is not yet clear what caused the ferry, carrying mainly school students, to sink, but survivors gave similar accounts of a catastrophic event at around 09:00 (00:00 GMT). A picture of the fear and chaos on board has also been vividly drawn.\n\"There was a really loud noise and then the boat immediately began to shift to one side,\" said rescued passenger, Kim Song-Muk.\n\"People were scrambling to get to the upper decks, but it was difficult with the deck slanted over.\"\nIn pictures: S Korea ferry sinks\nStudent, Lim Hyung-min, told how he he jumped into the ocean wearing a life jacket with other youngsters and then swam to a nearby rescue boat.\n\"As the ferry was shaking and tilting, we all tripped and bumped into each another,'' Lim said, adding that some people were bleeding.\nOnce he jumped, the ocean \"was so cold... I was hurrying, thinking that I wanted to live\".\nPictures from the scene showed rescue teams balanced on the sinking hull pulling teenagers from cabin windows as other jumped into the sea as the ship went down.\nOther survivors have criticised the evacuation procedures.\nPassenger Koo Bon-hee, 36, told the Associated Press news agency that many people were trapped inside by windows that were too hard to break. He wanted to escape earlier but an announcement said passengers should stay put.\n\"The rescue wasn't done well. We were wearing life jackets. We had time,'' Koo, who was on a business trip to Jeju with a co-worker, said from a hospital bed in Mokpo where he was treated for minor injuries.\n\"If people had jumped into the water ... they could have been rescued. But we were told not to go out.\"\nAnother survivor told local television: \"The announcement told us that we should stay still, but the ship was already sinking and there were a lot of students who did not get out of the ship.\"\nKim Seong-mok told YTN that he was \"certain\" many people were trapped inside the ship as water quickly filled up inside and the severe tilt of the ferry kept them from reaching the exits.\nBut tales of heroism on board as the vessel began to sink have also emerged.\nOne crew member, named as 22-year-old Park Ji-young, is said to have lost her life while struggling to make sure passengers on the upper floors of the ferry wore life jackets and found their way out.\n\"I repeatedly asked her why she did not first wear a life jacket. Park just said she would get out of the ship after making sure that all passengers were out,\" a survivor told local media.\n\"Park pushed shocked passengers toward the exit even when the water was up to her chest.\"\nThe Korea Herald reports that she joined the ferry company in 2012 to earn money to support her family. When her body arrived at hospital, the paper reports, her mother cried: \"I can't believe you left us\".",

        "instruction": "Your task is to write an article discussing the impact of the minamata convention on global efforts to reduce mercury pollution and its effect on human health.",
        "output": "The Minamata Convention on Mercury is an international treaty that aims to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of mercury. It was named after the city of Minamata in Japan, where a severe case of mercury poisoning occurred in the 1950s.\n\nMercury is a highly toxic substance that can cause serious health problems, including neurological disorders, birth defects, and even death. It is released into the environment through various industrial processes, such as coal burning, mining, and waste incineration. Once released, mercury can travel long distances through air and water, contaminating ecosystems and accumulating in the food chain.\n\nThe Minamata Convention sets out a range of measures to reduce mercury pollution and its impact on human health. These measures include phasing out the use of mercury in products and processes, controlling mercury emissions from industrial sources, and promoting the use of alternative technologies and best practices.\n\nOne of the key challenges in implementing the Minamata Convention is the cost implications. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the financial burden of transitioning to alternative technologies and complying with the treaty's requirements. However, it is important to consider the long-term benefits of reducing mercury pollution, such as improved public health and environmental sustainability.\n\nAnother challenge is the availability and accessibility of alternative technologies. While there are already existing technologies that can replace mercury in certain applications, such as fluorescent lamps and batteries, further research and development are needed to find alternatives for other industries and processes.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Minamata Convention has already made significant progress in reducing mercury pollution. Many countries have taken steps to ratify and implement the treaty, and international cooperation and collaboration have been strengthened. The convention also provides a platform for sharing knowledge and best practices, which can help countries overcome the challenges they face in reducing mercury pollution.\n\nIn conclusion, the Minamata Convention on Mercury plays a crucial role in global efforts to reduce mercury pollution and protect human health. While there are challenges in terms of cost implications and the availability of alternative technologies, the long-term benefits of reducing mercury pollution outweigh these challenges. By implementing the treaty's measures and promoting international cooperation, we can make significant progress in reducing mercury pollution and creating a safer and healthier world for future generations.",

The `queryDeduplication` option is set to `true` for the client.\n\nOverall, the code provides a way to create an Apollo client that can execute GraphQL queries directly without using a network interface.",

    "input": "A Tri-band Antenna for Satellite Applications at C, X and Ku Bands\n\nAn ultra-broadband antenna that is compact in size, low cost, single-layer and fed using coaxial probe feed is designed for satellite application at frequency C, X and Ku bands. The antenna consists of a rectangular radiating element with a partial ground plane, which provides a wide bandwidth. The single U-slot was designed in the patch antenna to obtain a tri-band frequency response that covers frequency at C, X and Ku bands in the range of 4 GHz to 8 GHz, 8 GHz to 12 GHz, and 12 GHz to 18 GHz respectively. The features of the antenna was analyzed in terms of radiation pattern, antenna gain and the return loss. The antenna was designed and simulated using CST MW Studio software. The performance of this designed antenna was compared and analyzed by using three different substrate materials which are FR-4, Rogers RT5880 and PTFE. The simulated results obtained from the analysis parts show that Rogers RT5880 is the most suitable substrate material for this designed antenna because it is promising good results which can cover all frequency bands which are C, X and Ku bands and it also have a good return loss, Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) and gain as desired.",
