        "output": "Rose Eveleth, the journalist and podcast host, had always been fascinated by the future and the ways in which humans interacted with technology. In her spare time, she often found herself daydreaming about extraordinary experiences, like hanging out with a pack of foxes.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Rose decided to venture into the woods near her home, hoping to catch a glimpse of these elusive creatures. As she wandered deeper into the forest, she noticed a rustling in the bushes. To her surprise, a group of foxes emerged, their eyes gleaming with curiosity.\n\nIntrigued by their presence, Rose cautiously approached the foxes, extending her hand in a gesture of friendship. The foxes, sensing her genuine intentions, cautiously sniffed her hand before nuzzling against her palm. It was a heartwarming interaction that filled Rose with joy.\n\nAs the days went by, Rose continued to visit the foxes, forming a unique bond with each member of the pack. She would often bring them treats, and they would playfully chase each other around, their tails swishing in delight.\n\nOne day, Rose noticed a wounded fox limping through the forest. Concerned for its well-being, she gently approached the injured creature. With great care, she tended to its wounds, earning the trust and gratitude of the entire pack.\n\nOver time, Rose became an honorary member of the fox pack. They would explore the woods together, their laughter echoing through the trees. Rose cherished these moments, knowing that she had found a special connection with these beautiful creatures.\n\nIn the end, Rose's dream of hanging out with a pack of foxes had become a reality. It was a testament to the power of curiosity, kindness, and the extraordinary experiences that await those who dare to dream.",

    "input": "Article: We all use money every day. It is essential because we can pay money for whatever we want.Money is recognized as banknotes and coins. However,many years ago people couldn' t go to the shop and buy what they wanted.They had to get what they wanted through the barter trade .It was really difficult,for the barter often depended on coincidence of wants.For example,the seller of grain has to find a buyer who wants to buy grain and who also could offer something the seller wants to buy.And one more example,if a wheat farmer needs what a fruit farmer produces,a direct exchange is impossible because seasonal fruit would spoil before the grain harvest.The solution is to trade fruit for wheat indirectly through a third intermediate commodity ,such as cattle,salt,shells,wine.However,commodity money had their disadvantages.For example,cattle,fur,precious stones couldn' t be cut into smaller pieces and it was inconvenient to keep and transport them.Thus coins were invented. The earliest known coins in the western world came from Lydia in about 650 B.C.Greek cities,the Great Persian Empire and Roman Empire quickly adopted the new useful technique of metal currency.And by the end of the 6th century,coinages were common throughout the region.However,coins as well as commodity money had many disadvantages.For instance,coins quickly show wear  and they usually have small value,so it' s difficult to count large sums of coins. At first,paper money was used in China in about 650 A.D.After then,it was used in Persia and Japan.In Europe,paper money was firstly produced in the Netherlands in the 16th century and in the USA in the 17th century.Paper money is worthless but symbolic.In other words,paper money is just a note.It has a purchasing power because the government announces it as money and citizens accept it universally. \n Question: The writer explains the difficulty of barter trade by  _  . \n Options: (A) telling stories (B) using examples (C) presenting a theory (D) making a comparison \n Asnwer: B",
