The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47.  The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \"perhaps the happiest years of his life\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road.  Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Ch\u00eane-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan.  His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery.  \"Glowing obituaries\" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including The Builder, The Building News, and The Architect. His estate was valued at \"under \u00a314,000\" (equivalent to \u00a31,290,000 as of 2018).  A plaque to his memory was placed in the chancel of St Paul's, next to that of his wife. \nQuestion: What is the full name of the person Sharpe was buried next to?"

He is just one of those passengers that you can't please no matter what. Is he fussy? Let facts be submitted to a candid world: Quote: \"On the ultra luxury Radisson Diamond, the same waiters that served my partner and me were also serving a table of senior officers and VIPs. Their mineral water was poured from a bottle wrapped in a white napkin; our mineral water - the same brand (how did he know if theirs was wrapped?) -- was poured without the napkin.\" Holy cow! Mineral water without a napkin - How dare they! At the same sitting, the author complains of a fish head that has fish eyes staring out at him and, guess what, the fish smells fishy! That's an earthquake! More complaints: The food isn't any better than a three star hotel! (Ever stay at a three star hotel in France? The food is super.) More whines: The VIPs get special treatments and special parties (Shocking!), the music around the pool is too loud, too rap and hard rock, the free wine on board only costs the cruise line only $2, he cracked a tooth and the cruise line wouldn't pay his dental bill until he got a lawyer friend who obtained the money plus \"a meager compensation.\" But the thing that bothered me the most was his inconsistency. He berates the industry for alleged mistreatment of their employees and yet he himself seems to cause those employees more trouble that 99% of the other passengers and he can't figure out why those employees, like the bartender on page 157, whom he nagged for several days, hate him so much. He berates the passengers and ships for causing pollution, yet he himself has taken (and presumably will try to take) multiple cruises. The massive improvements in waste management and sanitation and pollution control and fuel efficiency are dismissed as not enough. He nitpicks about occasional oil spills but fails to mention that according to the US Coast Guard 99% of the oil pollution of the seas comes from natural sources, mainly undersea vents. But what's this? The author's website which is billed as a \"noncommercial site regularly updated with links to reports, investigations, and new developments regarding labor, ship safety, and security\" is not functioning. The website isn't function just the way this book isn't functioning. The best treatment for the likes of him is to throw him overboard or make him walk the plank.

As he exits the building with the remaining model, he collapses and is rushed to the hospital, where it is revealed he has advanced stage cancer and any treatment would be futile.\nGeorge decides to demolish the home left by his father and replace it with a house in keeping with the neighborhood. He enlists his son, Sam, who is alienated from his stepfather Peter and his mother Robin. Sam must spend the summer with George, who has not revealed his terminal condition, and help him with the house, but Sam makes it a point not to help him. When George refuses to give Sam money unless he works for it, Sam toys with becoming a male prostitute, but is nearly caught and flees from his first encounter. This leads him to steal George's Vicodin.\nGeorge slowly reconnects with Sam. Robin decides to assist as well, and she finds herself rediscovering George. Also joining in the construction are Alyssa, Sam's classmate who lives next door with her mother Colleen; local policeman Kurt Walker, George's childhood friend; Sam's young half-brothers Adam and Ryan; various neighbors; and eventually Peter, even after separating from Robin when she tells him that her feelings for George have re-awakened. George tells Robin of his disease, sending her into shock. George tells Sam, who is betrayed and accuses George of being selfish and takes refuge at Alyssa's house. George collapses and is found by Robin the following morning. Complications arise when neighbor David Dokos tries to halt construction because the building's height exceeds the allowable limit by six inches. His plans to halt the project are stopped by Sam, who recognizes him from his prostitution attempt and blackmails him.\nSam puts Christmas lights all over the unfinished house and shows George the gleaming house from his hospital window. The next morning, Sam returns to finish the house and Robin sits beside George until his death. Robin goes to the house and tells Sam about his father's death. Sam inherits the house he finished building. Sam gives the property to a woman who has been living in a trailer park. As a girl, she was injured in a car crash caused by his grandfather."

        "Can you stop using these three labels in 2015: 'Poor people,' 'date rape' and 'victim'. Can you banish the labels \"date rape,\" \"victims\" and \"poor people\" from your vocabulary in 2015? Labels can diminish and demean or to uplift and affirm people . 2015 will be a year of hope and dignity by redefining or banishing these toxic and harmful labels . In their place a more generous, positive and compassionate country will emerge . Here's why a deeper look at these three labels :. Date Rape . This is the most commonly talked about fear on college campuses across the country . 2014 was filled with stories of sexual abuse from the ranks of the NFL and their spouses to the iconic Bill Cosby . On college campuses date rape involves issues of consent and sobriety; of women who feel that they don't have the ability to consent or not; of alcohol and drugs like \"roofies\" used as excuses and no specific profile of the typical rapist . The words date and rape should never be accepted as co-joined words . My friend Tony Porter of A Call to Men says that gender based violence will only end when men address it and reassess what it means to be a man . He is correct . To be on a date is to enter into an exploration of romance, companionship and possibly love . It is about exploring the possibilities of human togetherness and relationship . Rape is a criminal and violent exercise of abuse and power . To disassociate these two words - rape and date - is to redefine the expectation of healthy and also criminal behavior . You can redefine the term date rape by celebrating the possibilities of healthy dating and mincing no words about the criminality of rape . Engaging young men in the cause of stopping gender based violence will bring with it lasting impact on healthy relationships . Victims . The accusers of sexual violence are commonly called victims . They are typically the victims of aggressive non-consensual sex . But to call them victims is to deny their courage and strength . The supermodel Janice Dickinson recently said that she is not an accuser . She explained this by saying that she is speaking her truth about what Bill Cosby did to her decades ago . How strong do you have to be to speak out against those who are iconic figures or heroes- whether clergy, Cosby or NFL players? To speak your truth against power typically results from years if not decades of inner work along with courage that reveals you have come to love yourself enough to not be intimidated by the powerful iconic figures who have committed sexual abuse . People like Dickinson are empowered, courageous victims . They give hope to others including the many men who feel that their manhood will be compromised if they speak out against their male sexual abusers . Empowered victims like Dickinson move us quickly from just feeling sorry to feeling admiration for their courageous empowerment . What happened to them is criminal and to label them as just victims demeans their courage . Empowered victims elevate their status and shine a bright spotlight on their heinous sexual aggressor . Poor People . A pervasive new classism in the United States has emerged according to columnist David Brooks of the New York Times . He posits that the meritocratic class view themselves as the respectable ones who have the ability to choose their own destiny . They view the poor as lazy, disorganized, violent and scary . In this view the poor are not proper human beings . It's a dangerous construct that dehumanizes vast segments of our community . I've spent a lifetime working with and knowing people who are poor . Most work hard and often at several jobs ; like other human beings they yearn for the best for their children and families and have aspirations to live beyond poverty . If the organization of the lives of those who are poor is different from that of the meritocratic class it is because of genetic roulette and the systems that often work to trap people in the mire of less opportunity . Brooks suggests that those who label the poor in this way live in a world that keeps them from knowing poor people . The label begins to be redefined when you take time to know those who are different from you . It is up to you to make change in the New Year by not accepting these labels and then redefining them . You will be part of creating a more compassionate, generous and positive landscape ."

        "Review: Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, oh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a \"fish out of water\" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the \"fish\" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the \"in your face\" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges).All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.

I have stayed at the Drake before and while it is nice, it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. We opted to walk across the street and stay at the Millenium instead. I know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and I have to say they have done a great job. This place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to Chicago on a college roadtrip (I did). But that is not the case any more. This property is directly across from the Drake Hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer (albeit smaller) room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel. The rooms are tastefully decorated (Asian influence w/flat screen tv) and the bed is very comfortable. The bath is small (no tub), but very clean and the shower is great. You are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting Chicago, so the room's size is not a big deal. (It works well with a couple, but a family of four may be a bit cramped.) The service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat. I would definitely stay here again, but the next time I would leave the car at home ($49/night parking is a bit steep). \nPolarity: Positive"

        "Context: To evaluate the clinical value of staging laparoscopy in treatment decision-making for advanced gastric cancer (GC).', 'Clinical data of 582 patients with advanced GC were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent staging laparoscopy. The strength of agreement between computed tomography (CT) stage, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) stage, laparoscopic stage, and final stage were determined by weighted Kappa statistic (Kw). The number of patients with treatment decision-changes was counted. A \u03c7(2) test was used to analyze the correlation between peritoneal metastasis or positive cytology and clinical characteristics.', 'Among the 582 patients, the distributions of pathological T classifications were T2/3 (153, 26.3%), T4a (262, 45.0%), and T4b (167, 28.7%). Treatment plans for 211 (36.3%) patients were changed after staging laparoscopy was performed. Two (10.5%) of 19 patients in M1 regained the opportunity for potential radical resection by staging laparoscopy. Unnecessary laparotomy was avoided in 71 (12.2%) patients. The strength of agreement between preoperative T stage and final T stage was in almost perfect agreement (Kw = 0.838; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.803-0.872; P < 0.05) for staging laparoscopy; compared with CT and EUS, which was in fair agreement. The strength of agreement between preoperative M stage and final M stage was in almost perfect agreement (Kw = 0.990; 95% CI: 0.977-1.000; P < 0.05) for staging laparoscopy; compared with CT, which was in slight agreement. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size (\u2265 40 mm), depth of tumor invasion (T4b), and Borrmann type (III or IV) were significantly correlated with either peritoneal metastasis or positive cytology. The best performance in diagnosing P-positive was obtained when two or three risk factors existed.\nAnswer: Staging laparoscopy can improve treatment decision-making for advanced GC and decrease unnecessary exploratory laparotomy."

        "Article: According to some researchers, you should not praise children for everything that they do. It does not help them build self-confidence. Most parents and teachers agree that praise can help increase children's self-confidence --the more, the better. However, according to some researchers, only proper praise is good for children. If adults praise everything children do, it makes children look for praise all the time, not trying to do their best. \"Teachers should not say things like 'good job' or 'nice work' whenever a child does anything. They should encourage them to continue to improve,\" some researchers advise. Another idea is that children with high self-confidence are happier, and do better at school. About this, Marshall Duke, a researcher in children, says, \"High self-confidence brought in by too much praise does not make children happier, get more, or become able to do more. Finding a child's advantages   and developing them can help build confidence more than too much praise can.\" Praise also loses its effect   if it is given equally to all students. \"It's important to tell children the truth about what they've done. Honest feedback   is far better than empty praise,\" Duke adds. \"People have got into the habit of not telling children when they're wrong. That makes it hard for them to deal with difficulties when they grow up. That's just how the world is.\" \n Answer: always look for praise"

Upon release, John Carter received a mixed critical reception, with praise for its visuals, Micheal Giacchino's soundtrack and action sequences, but criticism toward the characterization and plot. The film flopped at the North American box office, but set an opening-day record in Russia. It grossed $284 million at the worldwide box office, resulting in a $200 million writedown for Disney, against total production and marketing costs of $350 million.

        "Paragraph: Although Pfizer continues to test the drug, called dacomitinib, in another Phase III study, hopes for its success have now largely faded, according to ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum. \u201cWe believe consensus expectations (for the drug) will be close to zero given today\u2019s readout\u201d of unsuccessful trial results, Schoenebaum said in a research note. In one of the failed trials, called ARCHER 1009, patients given Pfizer\u2019s once-daily pill did not show improved survival without the cancer worsening, compared with Roche Holding AG\u2019s widely used Tarceva (erlotinib). Tarceva is the current standard of care in patients with mutated forms of a protein called Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). The protein plays a role in normal regulation of cell growth, but when mutated is believed to cause cells to proliferate and thereby help spur various types of cancer. Dacomitinib is designed to block several types of Epidermal Growth Factor receptors, while Tarceva and similar treatments for lung cancer target only one type of receptor. Cowen and Co had forecast annual sales of $500 million by 2020 for dacomitinib, if it were approved for lung cancer. That would make it a moderate-sized product for Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, which has annual revenue of $50 billion. Schoenebaum said there has been little investor interest in the drug and that Wall Street had expected it to generate annual sales of only $300 million by 2018. The second failed trial, named BR.26, involved patients that previously had failed to benefit from chemotherapy as well as from treatment with an EGFR inhibitor. Overall survival of patients taking the Pfizer drug was not prolonged in the study, compared with patients given a placebo. Pfizer said adverse events seen with dacomitinib were consistent with those seen in smaller earlier studies. In the meantime, Pfizer said dacomitinib is also being tested in a third late-stage trial, called ARCHER 1050, among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not received prior treatment. The study will compare dacomitinib with Iressa (gefitinib), an EGFR inhibitor sold by AstraZeneca Plc. Results from that study are expected in 2015. Pfizer shares were little changed in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Claim: Pfizer lung cancer drug fails in two large studies."

        "\"Oregon Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, doesn\u2019t tend to throw his personal weight behind many public bills. That\u2019s why the Oregon Capitol stood at attention when Courtney called for more money -- new money, dedicated money -- to pay for a game-changing boost in mental health services for children and adults. In an accompanying press release, his office noted that: \"\"Statistics indicate that one in eight children, and one in 18 adults in Oregon suffers from mental illness. The Oregon Health Authority also reports that the state is currently serving less than half the adults and slightly more than one-third of the young people who need treatment.\"\" PolitiFact Oregon was skeptical. Those stats seem high. The Senate president\u2019s office directed us to the Oregon Health Authority. People there sent us to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, and specifically, to its State Data Infrastructure Coordinating Center. These people take census figures annually and apply a standard formula developed in the late 1990s to determine how many people have a \"\"serious mental illness\"\" or \"\"serious emotional disturbances.\"\" We thought the number of diagnosed cases might drive the statistic, but that\u2019s not the way it works. Instead, the research institute applies a percentage to the civilian adult population -- in this case, 5.4 percent -- to derive the estimated number of people 18 years and older with a \"\"serious mental illness.\"\" The low side of the estimate is 3.7 percent and the upper side is 7.1 percent. In Oregon, 5.4 percent translates into more than 162,000 people out of 3 million adults. That translates into one in 18.5 adults. Let\u2019s move on to the claim that one in eight children suffers from mental illness. Children are treated differently. The institute takes census numbers and applies a poverty formula, so a state that\u2019s considered \"\"high poverty\"\" is calculated to have more children with a serious mental illness -- or in technical terms, \"\"serious emotional disturbances\"\" -- than states considered \"\"low poverty.\"\" Oregon is a mid-poverty state. The percentages do not vary dramatically among the types of states, 9 percent to 11 percent of children for a low poverty state and 11 percent to 13 percent for a high poverty state. In Oregon, an estimated 10 percent to 12 percent of children ages 9 to 17 have a serious emotional disturbance. Ten percent of Oregon children is one in 10. Twelve percent is one in 8.3. The average -- 11 percent -- is one in 9.1 children. Again, this is just for children ages 9 to 17, so the calculation doesn\u2019t capture the entire range of children. Remember that Courtney\u2019s claim is one in eight. Now what do we mean by a serious emotional disturbance? Or rather, what do the experts mean? We spoke with Dr. Ronald Manderscheid, executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors. He\u2019s the person who developed the federal algorithm used to estimate the number of adults and children with mental illness or emotional disability. In other words, he\u2019s a solid expert. There is an assessment scale used routinely by mental health professionals. The spectrum spans from 1 to 10 to 91 to 100, and assesses how well a person functions. A child in the top bracket would be \"\"superior\"\" in every facet of life, and have a healthy sense of confidence and take problems in stride. The scale also applies to adults. Anyone in the 51 to 60 bracket, or lower, is considered to have a serious emotional disturbance or mental illness. Adults in this bracket would exhibit \"\"moderate symptoms,\"\" such as occasional panic attacks, or \"\"moderate difficulty\"\" in social, work or school settings. Children in this group would have \"\"sporadic difficulties or symptoms\"\" in several but not all social areas. Symptoms would appear in times of distress. People in the 41 to 50 range would show \"\"serious symptoms,\"\" including frequent shoplifting or severe obsessive rituals, or \"\"serious impairment\"\" in social, work, or school settings. This person might have no friends or be unable to keep a job. Children in the 41 to 50 bracket would show serious impairment in one area or moderate problems with functioning in most social areas. Children may have frequent anxiety attacks or have an unhealthy preoccupation with suicide. The \"\"one in eight\"\" statistic cited by Courtney applies to children who top out at 60. How many children do we have in Oregon, in that age group? An estimated 437,053 in 2011. Just to give you an idea, that means about 48,000 kids in the age bracket who fall within the accepted definition. Again, that\u2019s an average of one in 9.1 kids. We also talked with Bill Bouska, children\u2019s mental health system manager, and Jon C. Collins, manager of health programs analysis and measurement, both at the Oregon Health Authority. We asked why go with the higher percentage? \"\"There\u2019s not a lot of difference between 11 and 12 percent. These numbers are meant to be very general numbers, and to guide states,\"\" Collins said. \"\"They\u2019re not meant to be precise figures, so picking something on the high side is a little bit safer than picking a number on the low side, since they are estimates.\"\" Let\u2019s go to our ruling. Courtney\u2019s office relied on national statistics to claim that one in 8 children and one in 18 adults suffer from mental illness in Oregon. We found those statistics and talked to the person responsible for calculating the federal formula used to derive those statistics. We understand this is all about estimates, but if we\u2019re going to boil it down to percentages, let\u2019s see what they are. A 5.4 percent rate translates into one in 18.5 adults who suffer from a mental illness that makes functioning moderately difficult. Manderscheid, our national expert, says the percentage used now is 5.8 percent, which is one in 17.2 adults, so Courtney\u2019s statement still rings true. (The number of adults who suffer from a mental health disorder in a given year is much higher -- one in four -- but they take medication or receive treatment so condition doesn\u2019t affect their ability to function.) With children, we find that the one-in-eight statement is slightly more alarming than the average would indicate. The average in Oregon is one in 9.1 with a high of one in 8.3. It\u2019s also important to understand that the statistic applies to a narrower subset of children, and that the statistic covers children who show sporadic difficulties in several but not all social areas.. Still, all in all, it\u2019s hard to argue with a nationally accepted standard, so we find these details to be additional information missing from an otherwise accurate statement.\""

        "Paragraph: The story does not talk about costs, which was disappointing. The costs of intensive medical therapy can easily be identified. Using an online pharmacy we calculated the costs to be about $1,500 to $2,000 annually for medical therapy, using generic drugs. Using the Health Care\u00a0Blue Book, we found the average cost of coronary artery bypass sugery and hospitalization to be about $62,000. We think that this is important information for readers that should have been included. The quantification here was presented in such a way to make it clear to readers that there was no significant benefit found to surgical intervention, which is a fair conclusion to draw from the study. The story says, \u201cIn the Stich study, 41% of patients assigned to treatment with drugs alone died during the follow-up period, which averaged five years. That compared with a mortality rate of 36% among patients who received bypass surgery plus medication. Although the relative reduction in risk of death was 14%, the result didn\u2019t meet tests for statistical significance, meaning it could have resulted from chance alone.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s a great way to describe the lack of statistical significance. It would have been even more powerful to show readers the actual number of patients who died in each group. The story provides great information about the study itself and about the overall state of the evidence supporting heart surgery. \u201cHow best to treat these patients has been fraught with uncertainty,\u201d is one of the more notable phrases from the story. It also says, \u201cMany patients aren\u2019t evaluated for heart surgery to treat diseased arteries because they don\u2019t suffer classic chest pain or because doctors worry that hearts weakened by heart failure won\u2019t benefit from the procedure. Other doctors recommend immediate bypass surgery despite a lack of vigorous studies to support that strategy.\u201d The story does not engage in disease-mongering and takes a very careful approach to describing the types of patients who would be affected by this study\u2019s results. We also like the way they provided snapshots of patients who were in both arms of the study \u2014 surgery and non-surgery \u2014 at the end of the story, making it clear, as the study did, that both routes can be equally successful. The story brings in some strong independent voices who help make sense of this complicated study: James Fang, a cardiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, Raymond Gibbons, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, and Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. Rarely do you see a story that spends as much time with independent experts as it does with the authors of the study. The story does a great job showing how the standard interventions for heart disease stacked up against each other in this study. We wish that some mention had been made of diet and exercise and that at least a sentence had been included about whether there might be differences in outcomes seen as a result of different medication patterns. The story doesn\u2019t make it clear what exactly the patients were taking. The story makes it clear that the range of treatments studied by the authors are widely available. The story makes it clear that there is a great need for more evidence in this field and that this study will be surprising to many clinicians because of a long-held assumption that surgery is the superior option. tudies published in the early 1990s supported the view that bypass surgery provided a better long term outcome. The story does not rely on a news release. Claim: More Options Before Bypass Surgery, Study Finds"

The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying \"I couldn't find anything to praise\". Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I'm gibbering \u2013 what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1?\nThe co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I'd forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I've found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it's rubbish?\nIn many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I'm not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture. Question: Who said \"I couldn't find anything to praise\"?"

        "Over 100 passengers, who were invited to take the first Stoosbahn ride Friday evening, said the ride was \"incredibly steep,\" \"just amazing,\" and that they felt like they were \"in an elevator.\" \n  \n President Doris Leuthard formally cut the ribbon Friday to open the world's steepest funicular railway line in the Alpine village of Stoos. The president, who has a fear of heights, then took the maiden voyage with other passengers. \n  \n \"What we do in politics is trivial in comparison to this work,\" Leuthard said upon reaching the destination, adding the ride was \"pure thrill, just great.\" \n  \n The line, heralded as the steepest in the world, climbs 743 meters (2,438 feet) over a span of 1,738 meters. At one point, the train needs to move at a nearly 48-degree angle to negotiate a 110-meter climb while traveling only 100 meters horizontally. \n  \n To do that, the funicular features high-tech carriages with hydraulically controlled floors so that passengers in the barrel-shaped cars are able to remain upright as the train travels up the Alpine slopes outside Lake Lucerne. \n  \n The Stoosbahn will go into public service on Sunday. \n  \n \"After 14 years of planning and building, everyone is very proud of this train,\" said Ivan Steiner, spokesman for Switzerland's national railway. \n  \n Taking the record from the neighbors \n  \n While the 52-million-Swiss franc ($52.6 million, \u20ac44.6 million) project grew into a media sensation, it was born out of necessity, engineers say. \n  \n \"We did not set out to build a world record-breaking railway,\" says project manager Bruno Lifart, cited in a report by Swiss national broadcaster SRF. Alternative ideas proved impractical, and rebuilding the pre-existing line would have cut off the village of Stoos from the world for at least two years, he added. \n  \n Building the new railway line brought problems of its own, with the project's end date pushed back by two years, according to Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. The biggest issue, reports the reputable Swiss daily, was constructing the three tunnels along the route. \n  \n Once opened, the Stoos railway line will take the title of world's steepest funicular from the nearby Luzerner Hausberg Pilatus, which was built in 1889. ||||| Schwyz-Stoos funicular, hailed as triumph of engineering, goes into service on Sunday \n  \n Swiss engineering and technology have reached new heights with the opening of the world\u2019s steepest funicular rail line. \n  \n The \u20ac44.6m Schwyz-Stoos funicular (Standseilbahn Schwyz-Stoos in German), which goes into public service on Sunday, has been hailed as a triumph of modern design engineering. \n  \n  \n  \n A level-adjusting function will allow the space-age-looking carriages, accessible to all users, to remain horizontal while speeding up the mountain at up to 10 metres a second. \n  \n It is due to be opened on Friday by the president of the Swiss federal council, Doris Leuthard, in the Alpine resort of Stoos, 1,300 metres (4,300ft) above sea level in central Switzerland. \n  \n  \n  \n The train, two lines of cylindrical carriages, resembling beer barrels, will allow passengers to remain upright at all times, even as they ascend \u2013 or descend \u2013 the 1,720-metre track, climbing or descending 743 metres along gradients as steep as 110% (47.7\u00ba). \n  \n It will run from the valley station near Schwyz into the mountain village of Stoos, population 100, about 30 miles (50km) south of Zurich. \n  \n Ivan Steiner, a spokesman for the railway, said the funicular replaced an older one that had operated since 1933. \u201cAfter 14 years of planning and building, everyone is very proud of this train,\u201d he said. \n  \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest The funicular. Photograph: Urs Flueeler/EPA \n  \n The Gondola Project, a website dedicated to cable-propelled transport systems, said the scheme had faced a number of challenges even before work had begun. Then when construction started in July 2013, it faced hold-ups. \n  \n \u201cDesigners analysed 15 different options before selecting the existing route alignment and technology,\u201d it wrote. \n  \n A traditional aerial gondola funicular was ruled out because it would have had to pass through an active shooting range. \n  \n \u201cThe Stoos funicular is designed with an inclination adjustment system. This means that the four 34-passenger rotating cabins on each train remain horizontally level throughout the journey.\u201d \n  \n The Gelmerbahn funicular at Bern was previously the world\u2019s steepest, with a maximum gradient of 106%. \n  \n The East Cliff Lift funicular railway in Hastings, built in 1902, is the steepest in England, with a gradient of 78%. |||||"

        "Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane is upset by his team's loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002, but must overcome Oakland's limited payroll.During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him (out of high school), Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal prospect, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. After some prodding, Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and surmised that Beane would probably have accepted a scholarship to Stanford instead. Impressed, Beane hires the inexperienced Brand to be the Athletics assistant general manager.Oakland team scouts are first dismissive and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players. Most notably, Grady Fuson aggressively confronts Beane, causing him to be fired. Grady then takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on-base percentage (OBP). Beane signs the ones Brand suggests, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford, past-his-prime outfielder David Justice, and injured Scott Hatteberg. Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager, who does not agree with the new philosophy. With tensions already high between the two due to a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and plays a lineup he prefers.Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course. He trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos Pe\u00c3\u00b1a, to force Howe to use Hatteberg at that position, threatening to make similar deals if Howe won't cooperate. The A's win 19 consecutive games, tying for the longest winning streak in American League history. Beane's young daughter implores him to go to a game against the Kansas City Royals, where Oakland is already leading 11\u00e2\u0080\u00930 after the third inning and appears set to win a record-breaking 20th game in a row. Like many baseball players, Beane is superstitious and avoids games in progress, but upon hearing how well the game is going on the radio, he decides to go. Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the team falter and eventually allow the Royals to even the score at 11. Finally, the A's do win, on a walk-off home run by Hatteberg.After celebrating that, however, the A's again lose in the postseason, this time to the Minnesota Twins. Beane is disappointed, believing nothing short of a championship should be considered a success. He is contacted by the owner of the Boston Red Sox, who realizes that the sabermetric model is the future of baseball. Beane declines an opportunity to be GM of the Red Sox, despite the $12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest-paid general manager in sports history. He returns to Oakland, while an epilogue reveals that two years later, the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series, using the model pioneered by the Athletics., Question: ON WHAT BASIS DOES BRAND SELECT HIS PLAYERS?"

        "It is clear that users should own and control their data and privacy. Utility providers are also becoming more interested in guaranteeing data privacy. Therefore, users and providers can and should collaborate in privacy protecting challenges, and this paper addresses this new paradigm. We propose a framework where the user controls what characteristics of the data they want to share (utility) and what they want to keep private (secret), without necessarily asking the utility provider to change its existing machine learning algorithms. We first analyze the space of privacy-preserving representations and derive natural information-theoretic bounds on the utility-privacy trade-off when disclosing a sanitized version of the data X. We present explicit learning architectures to learn privacy-preserving representations that approach this bound in a data-driven fashion. We describe important use-case scenarios where the utility providers are willing to collaborate with the sanitization process. We study space-preserving transformations where the utility provider can use the same algorithm on original and sanitized data, a critical and novel attribute to help service providers accommodate varying privacy requirements with a single set of utility algorithms. We illustrate this framework through  the implementation of three use cases; subject-within-subject, where we tackle the problem of having a face identity detector that works only on a consenting subset of users, an important application, for example, for mobile devices activated by face recognition; gender-and-subject, where we preserve facial verification while hiding the gender attribute for users who choose to do so; and emotion-and-gender, where we hide independent variables, as is the case of hiding gender while preserving emotion detection."

Also, we asked property manager before we drilled those holes and he never once mentioned that it should be 'nail size' or we will be charged for the repair. As a matter of fact, lease says that riversedge maintainence willl remove the toggle bolts - do nails need toggle bolts?These costs are minor compared to the rent we paid and as I mentioned before its not a deal breaker but it should have been mentioned in the lease or clearly told before hand.

Town or city twinning means two towns in different countries agree and decide to become \"twins\" with sister city relationship. Their citizens find pen friends in the twin town. They exchange newspapers and stamps. The school teachers discuss teaching methods with the teachers in the twin town. Officials visit the twin town for celebrations. Ordinary citizens travel to the twin town, too, but not very often if it is far away. Sometimes, schools even exchange their classes for two or three weeks! For example, German middle school students study for a while at the school in their twin town in Britain, staying with British families. A few months later, their British friends come to study in Germany. Some towns even arrange exchange visits for theatre groups, choirs and orchestras ( ). Others send lecturers to the twin town who tell the people there all about their own town , and show photos and slides. Town twining can help make friends and motivate  people to learn from each other. It helps students to improve their language skills, and it contributes to  strengthening peace and understanding between different nations. \n Answer: Town Twinning"

Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.

President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that \"then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,\" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. \"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\" Bush will say. \"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \" the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. \"Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,\" Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \"President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. \"While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall.\" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to \"provide broader context\" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop \"surge\" in Iraq until the report comes out in September.  Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government \u00bb . It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. \"In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,\" Bush will say. \"Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies.\" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time \"critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home.\" \"While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,\" Bush will say. \"Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.\" E-mail to a friend ."

        "With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it, Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism. Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24\u201310 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives, but failed to get a first down on each one."

According to the packaging, \"it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.\"  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but \"cane juice\" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.

The aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of aortic valve bioprosthesis replacement for SVD in patients with mismatch to a population without mismatch.', 'Three hundred eighty-seven adult patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis from 1974 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Mismatch was considered to be present if the anticipated indexed effective orifice area was <0.70\\u2009cm(2) /m(2) . The median follow-up period was 7.2 years. Follow-up was 97% complete.', \"Patient-prosthesis mismatch was present in 12% of the study population (n\\u2009=\\u200947). Ten-year freedom from reoperation for aortic bioprosthesis replacement was 74.3\\u2009\u00b1\\u20093.2%. During follow-up, 111 patients underwent reoperation for aortic bioprosthesis replacement. Causes of aortic bioprosthesis replacement were SVD of the bioprosthesis (n\\u2009=\\u200996), paravalvular leak (n\\u2009=\\u200910), and acute endocarditis (n\\u2009=\\u20095). According to unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with mismatch had a higher incidence of aortic bioprosthesis replacement for SVD when compared with patients without mismatch (log rank test: p 0.05). This result was confirmed by multivariable Cox regression analysis, which identified two independent predictors of aortic bioprosthesis replacement for SVD: patients' age (hazard ratio (HR) 0.967) and patient-prosthesis mismatch (HR 2.161).\\Question: Does patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients undergoing bioprosthetic aortic valve implantation increase risk of reoperation for structural valve deterioration?"

Decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. On the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. No kidding. The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. On the positive side, however, there were Aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. The king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. We had a largish TV with a DVD player. There is a safe and munchies. The gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. There are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. Suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to L2 to get to the gym. This way you dont have to traverse the lobby.

Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings. Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services. Question: Where do a majority of consultant pharmacists tend to work?"

A person in cardiac arrest doesn\u2019t breathe, doesn\u2019t have a pulse, and can\u2019t respond to you. Someone having a heart attack usually is conscious and breathing, has a pulse, and can answer your questions. Respond. Here\u2019s what you should do if you witness someone go into cardiac arrest: Call 911 right away, or have someone else do it. What happens in cardiac arrest. 1  Once the usual blood circulation stops, oxygen delivery to all vital organs is also stopped. 2  The pulse that is usually seen in the carotid artery in the neck as well in the wrists and ankles is lacking. 3  Cardiac arrest may lead to sudden cardiac death or SCD. If you survive a cardiac arrest, your doctor may start you on one or more treatments to reduce the risk of another attack. Medication can lower high blood pressure and cholesterol. Surgery can repair damaged blood vessels or heart valves. A previous cardiac arrest or heart attack; A family history of cardiac arrest or heart disease What to Do. With quick action, you can survive sudden cardiac arrest. CPR needs to begin immediately, and treatment with an automated external defibrillator within a few minutes. The pre-participation athletic physical examination is a useful tool to screen children andadolescents for their risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Commotio cordis is a situation in which the heart stops when the chest is hit by an object. Some are in-person courses; others are online. Many local departments of public health also provide CPR training, including \u201cfriends and family\u201d classes for people close to someone at risk of cardiac arrest. The investment of time and effort to learn CPR is small. The potential payoff \u2014 saving a life \u2014 is huge. How common is Sudden Cardiac Arrest? Sudden Cardiac Arrest is a leading cause of death in the U.S. It affects more than 356,000 adults (356,461 EMS-assessed individuals) outside hospitals each year. Does Sudden Cardiac Arrest mostly affect the elderly? No. While the average Sudden Cardiac Arrest victim is 60-years-old, SCA affects people of all ages\u2014even children and teens. For People Who Have No Known Risk Factors for Sudden Cardiac Arrest CHD seems to be the cause of most SCAs in adults. CHD also is a major risk factor for angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart attack, and it contributes to other heart problems. Some people choose to avoid aggressive measures at the end of life. A do not resuscitate order (DNR) in the form of an advance health care directive makes it clear that in the event of cardiac arrest, the person does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cardiac arrest involves the cessation of the heart muscle pumping blood through the body. If the body doesn't pump blood through the body, the other organs are deprived of oxygen including the brain resulting in irreversible brain injury.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

How did these players get that way---was it through training and practice, or are great players \"born, not made\"? First, these players came from places that have had famous stars in the past---players that a young boy can look up to and try to imitate. In the history of soccer, only seven countries have ever won the World Cup---three from South America and four from Western Europe. There has never been a great national team---or a really great player---from North America or from Asia. Second, these players have all had years of practice in the game. Alfredo Di Stefano was the son of a soccer player, as was Pele. Most players begin playing the game at the age of three or four. Finally, many great players come from the same kind of neighborhood---a poor, crowded area where a boy's dream is not to be a doctor, lawyer, or businessman, but to become a rich, famous athlete or entertainer. For example, Liverpool, which produced the Beatles, had one of the best English soccer teams in recent years. Pele practiced in the street with a \"ball\" made of rags. And George Best learned the _ that made him famous by bouncing the ball off a wall in the slums  of Belfast. All great players have a lot in common, but that doesn't explain why they are great. Hundreds of boys played in those Brazilian streets, but only one became Pele. The greatest players are born with some unique quality that sets them apart from all the others. \n Question: According to the writer, which of the following statements is true? \n Options: (A) Soccer is popular all over the world, but truly great players are few. (B) Millions of people all over the world are playing soccer, but only seven countries have ever had famous stars.

In the film, during a harsh thunderstorm, a group of six people arrives at the mansion of an old puppetmaker and his wife.

The main cast includes Jami Gertz, Lenny Venito, Simon Templeman, Toks Olagundoye, Clara Mamet, Tim Jo, Ian Patrick, Max Charles, and Isabella Cramp. Context_4 : Ian Patrick was the Private Secretary to the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina when Lord Ashdown occupied the role, working with Edward Llewellyn. Ian Patrick was Lord Ashdown's Private Secretary from 1998-2002, prior to going to Bosnia and features in Lord Ashdown's autobiography, \"A Fortunate Life\" which he encouraged Ashdown to write. For his work in Bosnia Ian was awarded the MBE in the 2006 New Year Honours List. Ian Patrick is currently a special advisor to Sir John Sawers GCMG. Context_5 : Ian Patrick Sandbrook was born 22 March 1983 in Palmerston North. He is a New Zealand cricketer who has played for the Central Districts Stags and he has also played for Manawatu in the Hawke Cup. Context_6 : An autobiography (from the Greek, \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2-\"autos\" self + \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2-\"bios\" life + \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd-\"graphein\" to write) is a self-written account of the life of a person. The word \"autobiography\" was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical \"The Monthly Review\", when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as \"pedantic\". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by Robert Southey in 1809. Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that \"[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time\". Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life. Context_7 : Ian Patrick Harte (born 31 August 1977) is a football agent and a retired Irish footballer who played as a defender and was best known for his ability to score goals from long range, including being a free kick specialist.

Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank hereby appoint  the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and marketing agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Common Shares and to  advise and assist the Company and the Bank with respect to the Company's sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering  in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation (if necessary).\n\nOn the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the  Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Bank as to the matters set forth in the letter  agreement, dated June 9, 2009, between the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) (the Engagement Letter). It is  acknowledged by the Company and the Bank that the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares or be obligated to take any action which  is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.\n\nThe obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the End Date). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End  Date, the Company and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.\n\nIn the event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of    Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the  Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus  accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof.

In no  event shall the success fee paid for the sale of Common Stock in the Subscription and Community Offering be less than $200,000. The management  fee will be applied against the first success fee.\n\n(c) If any of the Common Shares remain available after the Subscription Offering, at the request of the Company, the Agent will seek to form a  syndicate of registered broker-dealers (Selected Dealers) to assist in the sale of such Common Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the  terms and conditions set forth in the selected dealers agreement. The Agent will endeavor to distribute the Common Shares among the Selected  Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objectives of the Bank and the Plan. The Agent will be paid a fee not to exceed 5.5% of the  aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. The Agent will pass onto the Selected Dealers who assist in  the Syndicated Community Offering an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for comparable amounts of  stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to purchases effected with the assistance of Selected  Dealers other than the Agent shall be transmitted by the Agent to such Selected Dealers. The decision to utilize Selected Dealers will be made by  the Company upon consultation with the Agent.\n\n(d) The Company and the Bank shall reimburse the Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging,  photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers.

The payment of such expenses assume no unusual  circumstances or delays, or a re-solicitation in connection with the subscription and community offering. The Company and the Bank acknowledge  that such expense cap may be increased by mutual consent, including in the event of a material delay in the Offering which would require an  update of the financial information in tabular form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original filing.\n\nSection 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion, including without limitation, the sale of  all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Company agrees to issue, or have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release  for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided,  however, that no funds shall be released to the Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the  reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and its counsel.

and they have found such amounts and  percentages to be in agreement therewith (subject to rounding).\n\n(i) At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a letter dated the Closing Date, addressed to the Agent, confirming the statements made by Hazlett,  Lewis & Bieter, PLLC in the letter delivered by it pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section 8, the specified date referred to in clause (i) of  subsection (h) to be a date specified in the letter required by this subsection (h) which for purposes of such letter shall not be more than three  business days prior to the Closing Date.\n\n(j) At the Closing Date, the Company shall receive a letter from Keller & Company, Inc., dated the Closing Date (i) confirming that said firm is  independent of the Company and the Bank and is experienced and expert in the area of corporate appraisals within the meaning of Title 12 of the  Code of Federal Regulations, Section 563b.200(b), (ii) stating in effect that the Appraisal prepared by such firm complies in all material respects  with the applicable requirements of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and (iii) further stating that its opinion of the aggregate pro forma  market value of the Company including the Bank, as most recently updated, remains in effect.\n\n(k) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive: (i) a copy of the letters from the OTS approving the Form AC, the Holding Company  Application and authorizing the use of the Prospectus and the establishment of the Foundation, including the issuance of shares thereto;

Any certificate signed by an officer of the Company or the Bank and delivered  to the Agent or to counsel for the Agent shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or the Bank, as the case may be, to the  Agent as to the statements made therein.\n\nSection 9. Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Company and the Bank jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its officers and directors, employees and  agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against  any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, settlement expenses), joint or several, that the Agent  or any of them may suffer or to which the Agent and any such persons may become subject under all applicable federal or state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly reimburse the Agent and any such persons upon written demand for any expense (including all fees and disbursements of  counsel) incurred by the Agent or any of them in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims  (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue  statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the  General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) or any instrument or document executed by the Company or the Bank or based upon written information supplied by the  Company filed in any state or jurisdiction to register or qualify any or all of the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom or provided to any state  or jurisdiction to exempt the Company or the Bank as a broker-dealer or its officers, directors and employees as broker-dealers or agents, under the  securities laws thereof (collectively, the Blue Sky Application), or any document, advertisement, oral statement or communication (Sales  Information) prepared, made or executed by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank with its consent and based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction, in order to qualify or register the Shares or to claim  an exemption therefrom under the securities laws thereof; (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the  foregoing documents or information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based  upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information  or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this  paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statement or  alleged untrue material statement in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer- Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC, the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or Sales  Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent or its counsel regarding  the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent regarding  the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements; and, provided  further, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent prohibited by the Commission, the OTS, the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System.\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Bank, their directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls  the Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,  damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, which they, or any of them, may suffer or to  which they, or any of them may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Company,  the Bank, and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by  them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or  threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any  amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information, (ii) are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading, or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or  any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other  documentation distributed in connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's obligations under this Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged material fact was  omitted from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or  Sales Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by the Agent or its counsel  regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by  the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements.\n\n(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action, proceeding, claim (whether commenced or  threatened), or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall  not relieve it from any liability which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise. An indemnifying party may participate at its own  expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly  with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the  indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that  there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying  party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the  indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any special counsel that said firm may  retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or  claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\nSection 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in  Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the Bank or the Agent, the  Company, the Bank and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or  proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company, the Bank or the Agent from persons other than the other parties  thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the  Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Company and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the  allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by  such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company and the Bank on the one hand  and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on  the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the  untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by  the Company and the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information  and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and  equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not  take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result  of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be  deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any  such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be  required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to  the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this  Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company, the Bank and the  Agent under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Agent may otherwise have. For  purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent's, the Company's or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the  Agent or the Company or the Bank within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on  the one hand, or, the Company or the Bank on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of  commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against  another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall  not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section  10.\n\nSection 11. Survival of Agreements, Representations and Indemnities. The respective indemnities of the Company, the Bank and the Agent, the  representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement and  the provisions relating to contribution shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, the Company, the Bank or any controlling person referred to in Section 9 hereof, and shall  survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the Shares, and any successor or assign of the Agent, the Company and the Bank,  and any such controlling person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 12. Termination. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section 12 at any time after this  Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n(a) If any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted the United States securities markets such as to make it, in  the Agent's reasonable opinion, impracticable to proceed with the offering of the Shares; or if trading on the NYSE shall have suspended (except  that this shall not apply to the imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading); or if the United States shall have become involved  in a war or major hostilities; or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by a state or federal authority which has a material effect on the  Company on a consolidated basis; or if a moratorium in foreign exchange trading by major international banks or persons has been declared; or if  there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Bank, or if the Bank shall have  sustained a material or substantial loss by fire, flood, accident, hurricane, earthquake, theft, sabotage or other calamity or malicious act, whether or  not said loss shall have been insured; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or  business of the Bank.\n\n(b) In the event the Company fails to sell the required minimum number of the Shares by the date when such sales must be completed, in  accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion Regulations, and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon  refund by the Company to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such  person, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other hereunder,  except as set forth in Sections 2(a) and (d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(c) If any of the conditions specified in Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, unless waived in writing, or  by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all of the Agent's obligations hereunder may be cancelled by the Agent by notifying the Company of  such cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such cancellation shall be without liability of any  party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(a), 2(d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(d) If the Agent elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section, the Company and the Bank shall be notified promptly by telephone  or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\nThe Company or the Bank may terminate this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the representations and warranties or  covenants contained in Section 5 and such breach has not been cured after the Company or the Bank has provided the Agent with notice of such  breach.\n\nThis Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties hereto.\n\nSection 13.
